# Framer RSS

A simple way to create an RSS feed from your Framer-hosted blog.

Used [lambda-rss-node](https://github.com/jwilsson/lambda-rss-node/tree/main) by [@jwilsson](https://github.com/jwilsson/) as a reference point while making this.

## TODOs

-   [ ] Enable better caching mechanism so fresh RSS feeds are not generated at each request
-   [ ] Make Framer scraping logic more robust for posts
-   [ ] Improve UI of landing page to make initial setup easier
-   [ ] Allow self-hosting this project on Netlify/Vercel

## Contributions

I put this together for my own use, but any help is welcome!
